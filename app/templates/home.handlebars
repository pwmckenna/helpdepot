        <h4>How big of a job am I getting into?</h4>
        <p>I want to move my washer and dryer into another room. I don't know much about plumbing, electrical, or ventilation. Save me before I get in too deep!</p>
 
        <h4>Is that asbestos?</h4>
        <p>In old houses there's a lot of this stuff floating around. There's no substitute for getting it tested, but professionals will only need a glace to know those 9x9 tiles are trouble.</p>


        <h4>What's that thing called?</h4>
        <p>In my basement there are two 6x6 cement stumps coming out of the foundation that two huge pillars of wood sit on. I've always wondered what they're called (as well as the wood...pillars?), but I couldn't google it if I wanted to. <i>Cement stumps?</i> Sometimes I just know too little to even do research online.</p>

        <h4>Technique critique?</h4>
        <p>A professional drywaller can do a job in an hour that takes me a day. Sometimes it would be nice to have a pro just watch and provide tips. <i>Cut from the visible side. Not that side, the other side...</i></p>
